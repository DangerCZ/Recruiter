Danger's Recruiter 1.1.0
****************************
Are you tired of being a king that has to do everything alone? Now you can at least hire a recruiter that will keep your garrisons full for you.

Features:
- Recruit units automatically in towns and castles
- You can edit config.json to set your custom values and enable/disable recruiter for towns and castles separately
- You can upgrade your recruiter to get you more units per day but at increasingly higher cost
- You can enable or disable the recruiter (useful if you have issues with wages or food)
- Daily reports in log
